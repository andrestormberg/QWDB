# Overview of the Forms tab

**The Forms tab can be divided into two areas:**

The form list and form view.


### Form list


The form list contains a listing of all forms in the active planning application. The controller can open, delete (trash can icon) and move (drag&drop) existing forms and create new forms. A planner can only open the forms.


### Form view


The form view consists of four areas:


1. The form name (changeable by controller)
2. Toolbar for data and form operations
3. Form header for selecting dimension elements
4. Form grid / the "grid", which in turn consists of
	1. Column header
	2. Row header
	3. Cells

# Form configurations

**Learn how to create form folders, assign form permissions, and many other features.**

### Create form folders


The folder structure can be edited on the left margin in the "Forms" tab. By clicking on the pencil icon, the name of the folder as well as its arrangement can be changed. The folders can also be moved by drag & drop. If you click on the trash can icon, you can delete the folder. Subordinate forms of a parent folder can be moved instead of deleted by a check mark.


The currently selected hierarchy level is colored purple.


### Set form permissions


When creating a new form, three options can be used to decide whether the form should be visible to "Owners only", "Specific team members" or "The entire team". The button in the upper right corner can be used to change the permissions for an already existing form.


When you select the option "specific team members" a dialog appears where you can place a checkmark next to the team members who should be granted access to the form. Using the drop-down menu at the top of the dialog, you can adopt the release rules of another, already existing form that is not released "Only for owner" or "For the entire team".


 


Hide empty/zero value axis elements (rows and columns).  
Using the filter function, it is possible to remove rows or columns from the form if they are empty or contain a zero.  
  
Clicking on the "Edit row" button opens a field that allows editing and adjusting the rows. If you check the checkbox "Hide blank rows", QVANTUM will hide all rows that are empty or have zero values.  
  
If a comment row is empty, but the corresponding data row contains data, the comment row remains hidden. The same applies to empty tabs/subcategories of subfolders that are filled.  
  
Hiding can be temporarily reset using the "Deactivate filter". The "Expand" and "Collapse" buttons are used to show and hide the category columns.

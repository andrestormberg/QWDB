# Authentication via SSO

**How can users authenticate themselves via SSO?**

Before you can log in via SSO, it is important to make sure that your IT department supports this authentication procedure and provides you with the necessary IDs.


Additionally, please keep in mind that Qvantum needs to be configured for SSO login. If you require assistance with this, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team.  
  




Once the Qvantum IT team has configured the access authorizations for the owners of a planning application, you will be able to set up access authorizations for the planners yourself by entering their respective SSO ID.



 


To enable planners in your team to log in via single sign-on, you need to expand the team master data. To do this, export the master data on the Team tab.


In the exported CSV file, you will find an additional column containing the master data. This column should be labeled as "single-sign-on-user-id". It is important to ensure that the IDs are written identically in order for them to be correctly interpreted.
